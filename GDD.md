# Project Archipelinaut - GDD

## Project Overview



## Marketing

It’s a game about a kung-fu duck that fights krakens, you’d have to be mad to not buy it.

## Gameplay

The Player’s Goal, and Reason for Being

You (The Player) have heard tales of a legendary sea creature that lurks the dark depths of the world’s oceans. Many years ago this creature, the Dreaded Kraken Calamari of The Cthultan Trench, ate the ship your father was sailing on during his time in the navy. Your father turned out fine, but he’s still pissed off about it. It was a nice boat, it had a beer fridge and everything. The appearance of The Kraken all those years ago brought about dark times, and the seas have been a dangerous place ever since. Years later, it is believed that The Kraken is emerging from the depths once more to destroy the world.

Now a young man, you have decided to take it upon yourself to slay The Kraken. Against your father’s wishes, you take the family’s pet duck to the local market in hopes to trade it for some magic beans. Unfortunately, the guy selling the magic beans is looking for a cow, so no luck. While you are at the market, The Duck gets hungry, and so you buy a tomato to feed it. But, you notice something; The Duck has grown slightly larger upon eating the tomato. You feed it another, and another, and watch as it slowly grows in size. You get an idea…

## Gameplay & Mechanics

### The Game and The Loop

The game will last around 30 minutes to an hour. In this time:

- The game world is randomly generated. Islands, oceans, enemy spawns, you name it.
- The Player will begin on a starting island, a Home Island if you will. The Player needs to acquire food to feed to The Duck in order to make it grow. The Home Island will have a town on it to offer quests to The Player to gain rewards.
- Once the starting island no longer has food to feed to The Duck, The Player will need to acquire a boat to move to a new island. Here, they will find items to use, enemies to defeat, loot to sell, quest objectives to complete and food to feed to The Duck. Once this island is empty, The Player can return to The Home Island to claim quest rewards and trade, and/or continue on to find a new island.
- On this new island, The Player will find more loot, food, enemies etc. Once the island no longer has food to feed to The Duck, the player will move on.
- This will happen several times throughout the course of the game. The Player will need to upgrade their ships, their equipment and train The Duck in order to face the tougher challenges and to travel further distances. Some new islands will have friendly coastal towns on them, so The Player won’t need to return to The Home Island all the time.
- After 30 minutes, every minute, there is a 10% chance that The Kraken will spawn somewhere on the map in a viable spawn location. The Player needs to prepare themselves and The Duck for the battle against The Kraken. They do not know where or exactly when the Kraken will spawn. However, they may find The Cthultan Trench; it is likely to be somewhere near here.
- After 45 minutes, if The Kraken has not spawned by now, it will spawn.
- After a further five minutes (50 minutes total by now), The Kraken will make a beeline straight to The Player and The Duck. The remainder of the game will be a battle between the two parties.
- If The Player dies at any point before winning the game, the game is over.
- Should The Duck die, the game is not necessarily over but The Player’s chances of winning are severely dwindled, as The Duck will be the main damage output against The Kraken. There may be opportunities to revive The Duck however, so all is not lost.

### The Player

- The Player is represented by an avatar.
- The Player has a pool of health. When The Player runs out of health, the game is over. Their health will be represented by a red bar.
- The Player has a pool of stamina. It can recharge slowly over time. Their stamina will be represented by a green bar.
- The Player can move across islands and dry surfaces with no problem. The Player can sprint to increase their movement speed temporarily to evade attacks or outrun danger.
- Moving through water is another story however. The Player moves slowly, and their stamina slowly drains while they are in the water. They cannot sprint to swim faster.
  - The Player will have another bar to represent their air levels. When this bar runs out, they will start to drown and quickly lose health. This air bar will be blue.
  - When The Player’s stamina runs out, they will move even slower.
  - If a player is thrown overboard or loses their ship, they will need to quickly return to solid ground, or find a buoyant object to climb on to such as another boat or their duck should it be large enough.
- The Player can perform basic attacks such as punching. To improve their attacks, they will need to equip weapons.
- The Player can only equip one weapon at first. They can equip either a melee weapon such as a sword or an axe, or a ranged weapon such as a flintlock or a musket. In order to pick up a new weapon, The Player will need to drop their existing weapon or put it in their backpack.
- Later on in the game, The Player may find a weapon’s belt. Once picked up the belt will be permanently equipped, allowing The Player to carry two weapons without needing to swap items from their backpack. The Player will need to swap between these two weapons, as they cannot use them both at the same time.
- Because the focus of the game is to feed and train The Duck, The Player's weaponry and means of attack will remain simple and limited. There may be a few unique weapons that deal extra damage and have cool perks, but these will be rare and difficult to acquire. The Player is often better off preparing The Duck than wasting time looking for rare items for themselves.

## The Duck

- First of all, The Player needs to be able to name The Duck.
- Secondly, The Player needs to be able to pet The Duck.
- Thirdly, The Duck needs to quack.
- With that out of the way, The Duck is The Player’s pet. The Player is training The Duck to fight The Kraken. The Duck will be the main output of damage against The Kraken.
- Should The Duck die, the game is not instantly over but The Player will have a very difficult time defeating The Kraken without The Duck’s help. There may be chances to revive The Duck however, so all is not lost upon The Duck’s death.
- The Player needs to feed The Duck to make it grow in size. Some foods are more effective than other foods.
  - A regular food item gives The Duck 3 size points.
  - A large food item gives The Duck 5 size points.
  - Etc.
- The Duck Grows after a number of points. This number of points will gradually increase as The Duck grows bigger.
- The Player needs to order The Duck to fight enemies in order for it to gain experience points. The more experience it has, the more powerful it’s attacks, and the more types of attacks it can make.
- The Duck cannot be told to perform specific actions. It can be told to attack from afar, to attack up close, or to follow the player and retreat. Otherwise, The Player has no control of The Duck’s actions, and it will attack enemies with the skills and abilities that it has learned.
- The Duck can traverse both land and sea with no speed impediment or loss of stamina. The Duck cannot drown.
- When The Duck has gained enough experience to level up, a small box with an “!” will appear above its head. The Player will need to go to a shrine in order to choose its next ability. The Duck will still be able to gain levels; XP gain will not pause if The Duck has an ability unlock pending. When this happens, The Player will be presented with three randomly chosen abilities; they will choose one of these three, or give it an ability card that they have found on their adventures. The Duck will then gain the benefits of this ability from here on out. Once The Duck has learned an ability, it cannot re-learn it to stack the ability.
- The Duck can gain up to 10 Experience Levels, and therefore 10 abilities, one for each level. However, The Player can feed an ability card to The Duck before it has gained a new level in order to gain additional abilities. But, there is a 50% risk that the card fed to The Duck will not take effect and will instead go to waste. Cards do not contribute to The Duck’s size.
- The Duck’s size and The Duck’s experience do not correlate. If you feed The Duck but do not train it, you will have a dumb tank; if you train The Duck but do not feed it, you will have a glass cannon.
- When The Duck reaches a certain size, The player can board it. From here, The Duck will start to earn stats similar to those seen on ships. It will be able to carry supplies, carry ammunition etc. The larger it is, the more it can carry. Certain abilities might enhance The Duck’s boat-like stats even further.
- If The Duck takes damage, it can regain health by finding food to eat on its own, or by being fed by The Player. Feeding The Duck when it is injured will still make it grow, but at a slower pace than if it had full health.
- When injured, food will give The Duck two less food points than it normally would. Food worth 3 points is now only worth 1 point, etc.

Duck Ability Card
What It Does
Good Constitution
The Duck gains all the growing benefits of food regardless of it being injured or not.
A Cool Hat
The Duck gains a cool hat. And a 5% damage boost.
Big Waves
As The Duck moves through a body of water, the rippling waves behind it will move enemy ships away from it.
Sonic Quack
The Duck gains a mighty quack that it can use as a ranged attack to deal great damage, but it has a thirty second recharge.
Duck Of The Line
Similar to large, end-game ships, The Player will have infinite ammo for their ranged weapons when riding The Duck.
Extra Life
Should The Duck reach 0 or less health, they will not die, but instead regain half a health bar. The Duck will not lose any learned abilities, but it can no longer gain levels. It can still continue to grow in size, and can be healed with food.
A Growing Lad
The Duck will immediately grow 10% in size, regardless of how big it currently is (maybe test this in balancing)
Bonus Levels
The maximum number of Levels that The Duck can level up to is raised to 12, an additional two levels and two abilities.
King Duck
The birds of the animal kingdom will see The Duck as their leader. Creatures like seagulls, parrots and pigeons will attack The Duck's enemies. Even bird pets belonging to pirates will turn on their owners.



## The Player’s Boat

- The Player’s Boat is used to sail the seas. The Player can only control one boat at a time. No matter the size of the boat, only The Player will be needed to man it.
- When The Player is onboard The Boat, it acts as an extended inventory. Ranged weapons will draw their ammo supply from The Boat’s hold; if The Boat has 50 bullets on board, The Player can shoot 50 bullets etc.
- When The Player boards The Boat, their ammo is immediately placed into The Boat’s hold. When they leave, some ammo is placed into their inventory from the hold.
- Boats are immune to small arms fire like muskets and arrows, but can take damage from cannonballs and are susceptible to fire. They can also take damage in bad weather, hitting hazards such as rocks and running aground in shallow waters if they are too big.

## The Ocean (and the landmasses within it)

The Ocean will be a dangerous place, full of mystery, pirates and treasures.

- The Ocean will have varied depths, preventing some ships from exploring those parts of the world.
- Shallow Waters will commonly be found near islands and landmasses, but may occasionally pop up in small patches far out at sea.
- Rocks are likely to spawn here, posing a risk to vessels.
- Coastal Waters will act as a merger between Shallow Waters and Deep Waters.
- Rocks will occasionally spawn here.
- Deep Waters will make up the majority of The Ocean.
- Pirates will mostly be found out here, on the hunt for loot and victims.
- Dark Waters are a dangerous place to be. If the Kraken is to be anywhere, it is likely to be found here.
- Tougher pirates will be found here.

## Coastal Towns

Towns give The Player an opportunity to find quests for more money and rewards, or to find a place to trade, or a chance to repair their damaged vessel for a cost. Coastal towns are usually safe places to be, so they can give The Player a rest from hunting pirates to regain their health, heal The Duck and repair The Boat with their own resources without needing to pay anyone to do it for them.

Towns may initially charge high prices for services and trading due to the ongoing state of the world. If The Player is able to defeat the pirates and enemies terrorizing the seas near the town, the cost of the services will reduce to a more affordable price.

## Shipwrecks, Ancient Ruins, Lighthouses and Other Points Of Interest

These sites of interest will give The Player opportunities to explore and find rare loot such as unique weapons, Duck Ability Cards, big stashes of money and so on.

Some of these sites will be structures in the world, such as an abandoned fort on an island that the player can run around in and explore. Others will be a single object that is placed somewhere on the map, such as a shipwreck or a lighthouse.

Point of Interest
What It Does
Spawn Location
Lighthouse
Reveals a chunk of the world in a radius around the Lighthouse.
On land, bordering the coast.
Shipwrecks
Contains a random piece of loot. The deeper the water it is in, or the further from civilization it is, the better the loot.
Some shipwrecks will have monsters within them or nearby to attack unsuspecting adventurers.
Anywhere there is water
Fort
Will have random loot and enemies in them. A pirate encampment perhaps?


Shrine
The Player can revive The Duck here should it have previously died. If The Duck is alive, it can:
Be blessed to gain full health.
Gain an extra life
Gain three random abilities from which The Player needs to choose one. This will be a bonus ability and will not count towards the 10 abilities earned from leveling up.





## Friendlies

Friendlies will help The Player and The Duck on their quest to slay The Kraken. They can offer quests and rewards, trade goods and repair equipment. Sometimes they may reveal a point of interest or give helpful advice if The Player talks to them. If they are under attack from an enemy and The Player steps in to save them, they will reward The Player with some money and information such as a point of interest.

## Enemies

Enemies will hinder The Player’s and The Duck’s progress. Defeating them will reward The Player with loot and money, and will give The Duck experience points needed to level up.


Enemy Type
Stats and What It Does
Spawn Location
Pirate Ship
Attacks The Player, The Duck and friendly NPCs
The deeper the waters they spawn in, and the further from a coastal town they are, the bigger and nastier the ship
Anywhere there is water, usually away from coastal towns.
Pirate
Standard enemy
Pirate camps on land, usually near the coast.
Sharks
Attacks and damages smaller boats, but leaves larger boats alone.
Can pose a great hazard to The Player and The Duck, as they are meaty and not wood.

Sirens will cause The Player’s control input to become sluggish, and will make ships veer towards rocks. The Player will need to send in The Duck to deal with them.
Anywhere there is water, but often on rocks or on the coast of an island. Do not spawn near coastal towns.








## The Kraken

The Kraken is the biggest, meanest son-of-a-bitch in The Ocean. If you are not ready for him, he will kick your ass. Only the hardiest and most prepared players will have a chance of defeating it.

The Kraken does not gain levels, it does not gain abilities, it does not gain buffs or nerfs depending on The Player’s or The Duck’s state; there is only The Kraken.

The Kraken has no friends, it will attack and destroy whatever happens to get in its way.
The Kraken has powerful ranged attacks and even more powerful melee attacks.
